üî• Extra Recommendation from me:
‚úÖ Make sure the Home Page has "Featured Products" and a "Today‚Äôs Deals" section to increase urgency and sales.

‚úÖ Add a Floating Chatbot (later) to help visitors ‚Äî even a fake chatbot that says: "Need help finding something?" can boost conversion.

‚úÖ SEO basics: Home page, product pages should have good meta titles and descriptions.

‚úÖ "Buy Now" buttons should have micro-animations on click.

‚úÖ Optionally: Add customer ratings (even if fake at the start) like ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê on the product cards to build trust.
